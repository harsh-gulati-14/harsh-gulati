    <p class="quote">Self doubt destroys more dreams then failure ever can
        I've seen many people willing to do great things, having #plans in mind, having #dreams. But, all they do is #daydream. Not because day dreaming is much easier than actually #working, neither because they are afraid of working #hard. The reason that I found most common between these people was that they are afraid of critics, they think more of things that can go #wrong rather than those which can go #right. 
        
        People think too much on whether people will #like their views or not, or maybe people will start #criticizing. Well I got one thing to tell you, 
        If the only thing you want to do is please people, and be liked by everyone, my friend you are going to fail!
        No matter what you do, there will be people who will be unhappy, so #stop #worrying about them and #work for yourself, not because it will give you fame, but because it is your #duty.

    <p class="quote">Everyone gets 24 hours in a day, some use their time to do something productive, some procrastinate, and some simply choose to do nothing. But there’s one more category, the people who think they are “too busy”, but actually doing the work that does not make much difference.
        Too much time is killed by the indigestion of tasks.
        Remove the unproductive (busy) work!
        Don’t be afraid to say no to the work that does not add value. Excessive busy work might result in burn out.
        Learn to set priorities. A successful man knows what task has what priority, he knows what he is doing and why he is doing that, this knowledge leads him to get his high priority jobs done. He works rather than making excuses.
        And always remember that
